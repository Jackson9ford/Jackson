			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The Challenge for me was wrapping my head around how the sorter works and then putting that into my code, because I was having a mental block, but once I worked on the code as I was directed, and then I played around with the sorter, it started to make sense. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> One of the problems I had was that I could not get the text to display whenever I wanted the hat to sort the name, but once I add the "let new text" line and adjusted my html to read the javascript, it was smooth sailing from there.  </p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I am happy with how this lab went, and it is fun to play around with the mechanisms after the code has been made, even though you can do it within your console, it can start to make more sense just by viewing the web page if you have enough things to mess around with and stuff is showing up. I use the "view in browser" function so often and it is extremely useful.</p>
