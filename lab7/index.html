			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for me was finding out how to get the javascript to display on the site page once again, because I had errors in my code that I could not detect, but help from another pair of eyes actually made me aware of the actual mistake

					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Like I said, my javascript was not appearing on the webpage, but then I realized that I had an error with my javascript and then it was smooth sailing from there. 
						I feel like this could be more calculated and not so random. One thing that I would like to figure out is how to get the username input bar to disappear once you have entered your name. I dont think it is supposed to stay there

						 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Once again, I feel like this lab was a somewhat more challenging repeat of the last lab, but I like how we learn in babysteps because it really seems to help me retain the information. I don't really understand where this building block is leading to and what skill it is going to help, but I am excited to see how it goes. </p>
