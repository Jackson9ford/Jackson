			<h1>Hello World - We are exploring CSS and HTML</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I feel like the challenging part about this for me is not having a device that is capable of coding in class, so following along has to be done outside of class using the Yuja 
						and I just wish that I was able to take it all in and go home ready, but you really have to follow along with this stuff, so I will need to adapt to the class structure 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The CSS will probably be hard to understand, and linking the file seems to be an issue, but I worked with my partner to figure out how to link the two, and learning all of this is a tetious process </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I have never coded, so using VSCode is something I have seen a lot of around campus, but I have never had a grasp on the use of it or remotely what is going on
						so it is exciting to be introduced to the platform, and hopefully I can use these skills to my advgantage. The structure of all of this seems very rigid, and
						it is exciting to see it used for the purpose of art  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> I feel like I am starting to understand why people have easier options for creating websites, and how paying for the service is actually very reasonable, because the design of websites is challenging, and making it look pretty is actually quite challenging. I am not understanding how to introduce the files of code and starting from scratch, but 
						Im sure I will know soon because I will get the answer in class
