                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>I did not know how I was going to debug any of my labs since I feel like I either turn them in once I've tried everything I can to fix them. So i chose one to look better.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I changed the code so that the javascript output would look better on the screen and I have put screenshots of the cod, and an example of how it now looks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This was challenging for me because I did not know how to fix the labs that I ran into a wall with. I dont think I will turn any in again just because I dont think it got much better besides the aesthetic value.</p>
