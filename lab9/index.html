						<p>I had to learn how to use jQuery so it was somewhat of a learning curve due to missing class on Halloween, but I am picking it up from the lecture video.</p>

					<div class="minor-section">
						<h2 id="button-problems">Problems</h2>
						<p>I had to go step by step with every move I made, and if I made the simplest mistake it would be hard to track back, but after experimenting it ended up working.</p>
					</div>
		
					<div class="minor-section">
						<h2 id="button-reflection">Reflection</h2>
						<p>Overall this was probably a more challenging lab for me, and I think that I would like to know how to do these things and make them look better. I am going to have to get help in class and in my section from people around me. I’m sure it’s not hard, I’m just missing something small most likely.</p>
