					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 3 was learning how to source your own images and link them through css to get them to appear on the website. Also sizing is a mystery to me and I messed around with it but I really don't know how it worked out. Hopefully the image will show up nicely on this page at the bottom.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was trying to get my image to appear but it wouldn't. I was using the examples on canvas, but they weren't helping me either. This is where my lab partner came in handy because I could look at their code, and spot the difference in what was missing or interfering with the image. I soon found out that I wasn't putting the right title of the image in HTML, and then it was all smooth from there.  </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>My favorite part about this assignment was the fact that I have learned how to put photos on a web page, and that is a pretty cool skill to have. I did not realize how tetious it could be to link an image accross source code, and it still feels like a mystery. The complexity of everything that I am learning feels so great, and I truly feel like I could come to understand a world I never even dreamed of understanding.
