                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p> I had to figure out how to structure the API request, handle JSON data, and display images on my webpage based on that data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>One of the main problems I encountered was ensuring that the data fetched from the API displayed correctly. There were issues with the button not updating the content without refreshing the page, which I solved by using jQuery's $.ajax() method for dynamic content loading. I also had to troubleshoot my HTML and JavaScript to ensure everything worked smoothly together.</p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Overall, this project helped me improve my understanding of working with APIs and dynamically updating content on a webpage. I feel more comfortable using AJAX and handling JSON data now, but I realized I still need to refine my deubugging skills for a more robust solution.</p>
