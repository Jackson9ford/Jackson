				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>I am not sure if the words that my button are generating are supposed to be full words, and I am not sure how you would code to make sure that the words are output only when they have a correct spelling. Other than that the lab was pretty straightforward..</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>One of the problems I had is that I didnâ€™t really know how to go further with the code, and I do not see how useful this step is in the proccess of learning, but regardless I am getting the work done and learning what seems to be quite basic..</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall this was a less challenging lab for me, and I think that I would like to know more of a bigger picture on learning these skills. I hope that this becomes something that feels more useful so that I can apply it to real world concepts or tools that can be used through the web.</p>
