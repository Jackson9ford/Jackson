				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>I had trouble in the beginning, but then when I looked at my javascript I realized that I needed to change it up in order for it to work with the HTML</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I did not have many problems besides adding "const" to my javascript and finally getting over the final block of my the work </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall this was a less challenging lab for me, and I hope that this becomes something that feels more useful so that I can apply it to real world concepts or tools that can be used through the web.</p>
