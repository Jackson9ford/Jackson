			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> I did not know how to use the tools in order to make my array display itself in a fashionable way. It was honestly challenging and I really don’t know how to make the connection, but I’m going to learn next time I go to class.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> One of the problems I had is that I changed the code a lot and I feel like I messed around with it but not a lot changed, and a lot would just disappear. I didn’t really know how to go further than what was displaying on the screen, and it wasn’t very fun to experiment because I wasn’t getting any further.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> overall this was probably a more challenging lab for me, and I think that I would like to know how to do these things and make them look better so I am going to have to get help in class and in my section from people around me. I’m sure it’s not hard, I’m just missing something small most likely. </p>
