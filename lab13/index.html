			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p> The challenge was not understanding if I needed to make the code so that people could imput their own factors, or if it was just to display a function that was written in the code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> I wanted to make the data more displayable across the screen, so that it would be more friendly to the eye and easy to view. This was challenging for me because we have not been taight yet and I tried to research but it never started to look better.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> Overall I think that I did the lab correctly but I feel a little in the dark about how to complete the actions of this lab if I did not do it correctly.</p>
			</div>
