					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I am trying to be happy through following the path that is right for me, but I dont know if I am completely sure where that path lies. I feel like I am in a constant and everchanging exploration of who I am, because I want to gain a greater understanding of what brings me joy and purpose. The problem is that I get so overwhelmed with this feeling that I lack action, the very thing that I believe will lead me to a greater state of fullfillment. Or is it? I want to continue to explore this question and ask people what they think.</p>
