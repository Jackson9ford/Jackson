			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to understand how the javascript is working, and how I am going to implement it in the future. I feel as if I am not retaining it to the point where i would know exactly what to do from scratch without guidance
						.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> my partner and I were wondering how to link the javascript to display on the page, but then we found out that happens through html. it is interesting to see how there are many files of information that link together to create what you see on a webpage. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I feel like this assignment was simple due to the fact that my knowledge is compiling to create a more holistic knowledge of the structure of websites, and I am already gaining my own ambition to look into coding a website for my own use in my personal life. I can now see new purposes for having a website.</p>
